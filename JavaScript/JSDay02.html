<!-- JS Day 02 - Numbers -->
<!-- This HTML file demonstrates JavaScript's number data type and basic arithmetic operations. -->
<!-- It shows how to declare number variables, perform calculations, and use typeof to check data types. -->
<!-- Also illustrates type coercion when concatenating numbers with strings. -->

  <!-- The script tag contains JavaScript code that demonstrates number handling. -->
  <script>
    /* ----- Numbers (primitive data type #1) ----- */
    // let declares a block-scoped variable. Here, age is assigned an integer value.
    let age = 18;           // integer
    // price is assigned a floating-point number (decimal).
    let price = 19.99;      // decimal (JS still calls it "number")
    // scientific notation for large numbers: 3e5 means 3 × 10^5 = 300000.
    let scientific = 3e5;   // 3×10⁵ = 300000

    // typeof operator returns the data type of a variable as a string.
    console.log("age is a", typeof age);        // → number
    console.log("price is a", typeof price);    // → number

    // Basic arithmetic: multiplication of price by 2.
    let total = price * 2;
    console.log("Total price × 2 =", total);

    // Concatenating number + string: JavaScript coerces the number to string and joins them.
    document.write("You are " + age + " years old.");
