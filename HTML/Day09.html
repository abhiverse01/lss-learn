<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- The html tag is the root element, with lang="en" specifying English language. -->
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <!-- meta charset sets the character encoding to UTF-8 for proper text display. -->
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <!-- title defines the page title shown in the browser tab. -->
  <title>Day 9 – External CSS</title>
  <!-- link tag connects the external CSS file to this HTML document. rel="stylesheet" specifies it's a stylesheet, href points to the file path. -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<!-- The body contains the visible content, styled by the external CSS file. -->
<body>
  <!-- h1 element styled by rules in styles.css. -->
  <h1>External CSS</h1>
  <!-- div with class="card", styled by the .card class selector in styles.css. -->
  <div class="card">
    <!-- p element inside the card, inheriting styles from the parent or defined in CSS. -->
